My name is Nadeen Shuweihat, I am an interior designer, a receptionist and recently i have started my new journey to become a software developer. On the same hand, to do that i have to work on my **mindset growth** and for you guys who doesn't know what's I am talking about I will help you in that by summerzing what i read about it.

**Mindset growth** in simple words is the love of learning and keep going on in your learning and developing journey until you reach your goals. To do that you need to keep in mind that you will face some challenges and difficulties but keep in reminding yourself as i do that:

- the path might be __long__ but tottaly worth it in the end.
- ***No pain No gain***
- it's **okai** to take a break from time to time reconfigure your level of focus and perseverance.
